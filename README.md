### DESCRIPTION

A README file that describes the overview of the repository, which will include at least 1 paragraph of technical information about the source code AND the link to your Adobe XD shared document.

The repository includes a data folder including all the csv sheets and numbers for the interaction of the project to flow. This is where everything was customized in terms of user flow. The assets folder shows all the images created and UI for the project. Using libraries p5.js/.sound/.clickable helped create the base. Sketch js drew and customized the buttons for the page. The HTML file was changed to center the pages on the screen. The complex state manager file helped go through all the data files to connect them interactively.
